These are codes and resources for the study "Distinct Spatiotemporal Patterns of White Matter Hyperintensity Progression".

For SuStaIn modeling, we utilized source codes ("SuStaInMatlab-master"; https://github.com/ucl-mig/SuStaInMatlab) developed by Young et al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0).

For bullseye presentation, we utilized MATLAB toolbox ("bullseye"; https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16458-bullseye-polar-data-plot) developed by Daniel Ennis.

**Examples**

example1.mat: Calculate WMH severity and run SuStaIn modeling

example2.mat: Individual staging and subtyping, based on the 3-subtype model developed by this study

example3.mat: Bullseye presentation


**Resources**

MNI_ch2better_WM_20ROIs: 20 ROIs from WM parcellation in MNI space (0.5mm X 0.5mm X 0.5mm)
